# Compiler
My first attempt at writing a compiler, it compiles a language that I am
kinda am making up on the spot while borrowing many concepts from C. It
compiles down to NASM x86_64 assembly but I plan on making it compile
directly down to machine code/implement my own assembler.

I would highly recommend against using this code for any purpose. There
most certainly are better compilers to look at if you want to figure out
how to implement something yourself. I just made this public so that I
would "force" myself to make code and commit history look a little
better(as if anybody is ever going to see this).
